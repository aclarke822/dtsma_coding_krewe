I mentored the David Thibodeaux STEM Magnet team building this application. They won best student team! It's an emergency preparedness application using Google Maps API and geospatial JSON datasets on Android. It was a one night coding event, 5PM to 10AM and it was a lot of fun!

Note: There might be some API keys in this repo. Security wasn't something I considered at the time. I have since deactivated them.
